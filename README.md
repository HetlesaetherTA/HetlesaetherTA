Hi, 
I'm Thomas.

I am an independent developer working on indevidual projects of
varying complexity. My goal is to become a "real" developer, and
be able to make a living from the consepts I've learned along the way.

My journey began in 2017 with basic HTML/CSS, and I'm currently (Fall of 2022)
teaching myself lowlevel systems with the end goal of creating an emulated version 
of a homebrew CPU designed by our team.
